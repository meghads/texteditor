This project implements a basic text editor using a stack data structure in C. It functions within the command prompt, offering a simple alternative for editing text files.

Features:

* Edit text using basic typing commands.
* View current text and cursor position.

Requirements:

* C compiler (e.g., MinGW)
* Basic understanding of C programming and stacks

Installation:

1. Download and install a C compiler like MinGW (https://www.mingw-w64.org/).
2. Create a new project folder for your code.
3. Copy the files into your project folder
4. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to your project directory.
5. Compile the code using a command like `gcc main.c stack.c -o texteditor` (replace `texteditor` with your desired output filename).

Usage:

1. Run the compiled program (e.g., `./texteditor`).
2. The program will display an empty text buffer and cursor position.
3. Type characters to enter text.
4. Switch statements specify the operations you can perform.
